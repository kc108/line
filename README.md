# TerraVerde: Technical Assessment

---

### Goal:

##### Returns a set of x, y coordinates in 2-dimensional space as an input, and that returns a set of lines that intersect 3 or more unique points from the input set. Used Intertools.

---

## Installation:

#### Import the following:

###### \*\*import intertools -> Used to compare all possible 2-pairs of lines that pass through points of intersection

---

###### \*\*import unittest -> Used to test functionality of all of the solution set possibilities

---

#### Run program by inputting the following:

##### python3 line.py

---

##### View the Integrated Terminal to determine if the following tests have run successfully.

---

Line: 2,2 -> 4,4
Line: 1,1 -> 4,4
Line: 1,1 -> 3,3
test_is_between_1 (**main**.LineTest) ... ok
test_is_between_2 (**main**.LineTest) ... ok

---

#### Expected Output:

##### Ran 2 tests in 0.000s

##### OK
